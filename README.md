# Ubisecure-TrainLocation

This is the repository to store the code for Ubisecure's Train Service exercise. The aim of the application is to act as a service to help the user track their train.

The application has been developed using MERN Stack with the additional implementation of Google OAuth2.0. 

## How to Run the application

1. Download/clone the source code.
2. Change directory to both backend and frontend respectively, open terminal and run **npm install** to get the required dependencies.
3. Change directory to frontend, open terminal and run **npm start**. This should start the frontend at Port 3000.
4. Change directory to backend, open terminal and run **npm run start**. This should start the backend at Port 8000.
5. After the app is running, you can register/login using the links provided on the homepage.

## Additional Information

The application is not complete because of many reasons, number one being the lack of time and energy. Secondly, the requirements weren't very clear so I could not implement it with full confidence. Lastly, my own lack of motivation for pure coding. However, I do plan to complete it in near future for learning purposes purely.
